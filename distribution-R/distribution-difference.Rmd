In the previous exercises we saw that the mean and median are very similar and so are the standard deviation and MAD. This is expected since the data is approximated by a normal distribution which has this property.

Now suppose that Galton made a mistake when entering the first value, forgetting to use the decimal point. You can imitate this error by typing:
```
library(HistData)
data(Galton)
x <- Galton$child
x_with_error <- x
x_with_error[1] <- x_with_error[1]*10
The data now has an outlier that the normal approximation does not account for. Let's see how this affects the average.
```
